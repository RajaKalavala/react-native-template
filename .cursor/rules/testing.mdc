## Frameworks
- Use Jest and `@testing-library/react-native`.
- Mock Expo Router with lightweight stubs for `useRouter`, `Link`, and `useLocalSearchParams` when necessary.

## What to test
- Hooks: state transitions, side-effect boundaries, edge cases.
- Components: interactions via accessibility roles/testIDs; ensure a11y attributes exist.
- Routes: happy paths for search params and screen composition.

## Avoid
- Snapshot-only tests for dynamic UIs.
- Testing library internals.

## CI
- Include `typecheck`, `lint`, and unit tests. Keep tests deterministic (no real network).
